1. The lowest-level automation history view (the graphical view) now shows the execution number and date in the top header.  The execution number is also now searchable in the top-level automation history screen.

2. The Update & Delete buttons in the automation editor's Manage Stored Data and Two-Way Sync Mappings screens no longer disappear when moused over.

3. In the automation editor's lowest-level automation history view (the graphical view), the Input/Output popover on actions no longer displays "CUSTOMER_ALERT" text in errors (which is text intended for alert emails).

4. In all right-click context menus throughout the UI, if an option is clicked but then the mouse is moved off the clicked option, that option will no longer be performed.  The menu will now remain open so a different option can be selected.

5. The automation builder has a new right-click context menu option to show and hide the ability to search all mapped fields for a given value.  Actions/conditions/loops that contain the entered value in their field mappings will be highlighted, and a count of the total matches appears underneath the search entry field.  As mappings are edited the number of total matches is updated.

6. Triggers and actions in the automation builder now have a right-click context menu with an option to highlight items that have mapping references to it.

7. The following single-click popover options in the automation builder for triggers, actions, conditions, and loops have been moved to the new right-click context menu: rename, edit notes, enable/disable, open assembly.

8. Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause the Input/Output popover in the lower level graphical automation history view to not show any output data for triggers.

9. Automation history searches now include action output data in the search logic, rather than just trigger data.

10. Searches for user accounts in the admin console's User Accounts screen and in the Switch Account dialog now return matches based on any portion of the email address.

11. In the admin console's User Accounts screen, the Reset Task Count, Assign Roles, and Reassign Content buttons have been removed and placed into the Manage Account dialog as hyperlink options.

12. If the top-level automation history is searched for an alert id (provided in alert emails), after clicking the error tile the next drill-down level's search field is now cleared so the selected error will appear.

13. Error tiles in the 2nd-level drilldown of automation history now display a link icon that can be used to obtain a link to the error.

14. If a user does a manual retry of a failed transaction and it succeeds, if the transaction is scheduled for auto-retry by the system the transaction will now be removed from the auto-retry scheduler.

15. The system's auto-retry schedule for automation failures has been modified.  Previously the system would auto-retry failed transactions (those configured in the system to be retried) for up to 3 times after 5, then 10, then 15 minutes.  The system's new auto-retry schedule is up to 10 total attempts after 15 seconds, then 30 seconds, then 1 minute, then 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, then 30 minutes, then 1 hour, then 2 hours, then 4 hours.  The new schedule provides for faster initial retries, plus a total timespan of almost 8 hours to accommodate extended API outages.

16. The content of alert emails now contains the automation's name.  Also, stack traces are now removed.

17. Searches for email addresses in automation history now seem to be working.

18. If an action is mapped to a Loop in the automation editor and that action is removed and its field mapping is removed, the editor now shows "No Action Mapped" for the loop rather than keeping an invalid field mapping to the removed action.

19. Conditionals and Loops in the automation editor can now be copy-pasted.

20. The right-click menu on actions, conditionals, and loops in the automation editor has a menu option to select the item and all following items in the branch.  The items are then highlighted.  Then clicking on a plus icon destination will show a menu option to paste or move the selected items.  Right-clicking on the automation editor's background will show a menu option to delete the selected items.

21. If an Action - Skip Data Row module or Action - Skip Subsequent Actions module is invoked, the lowest-level automation history now allows the skipped action to be inspected and its log viewed.  Previously the action would appear grayed-out and the log could not be opened.

22. In the lowest-level graphical automation history view, conditionals within loops now display per-iteration results in their mouseover popovers.  Conditional logs also now delineate each loop iteration.

23. The admin console has a new "Retries" screen that shows scheduled auto-retry transactions.  These were previously listed in the Work Queue screen.  The Work Queue screen now shows just the total number of currently scheduled retry transactions.

24. When triggers report an error, the automation now displays the error highlight in the automation editor's dashboard and the automation's history also now displays the error (rather than showing an entry with zero errors/successes/filtered).

25. The timezone pick list now contains all available timezones (over 600 locations), plus the displayed GMT offsets are now dynamically computed so they are accurate during daylight saving periods.

26. In the lowest-level graphical automation history view, only triggers that emit data rows are now highlighted in green.  This change only occurs for newly processed transactions going forward.

27. Webhook logs have been moved from the AppLogs/system subdirectory to AppLogs/system/webhooks.

28. Sent email logs have been moved from the Tomcat /logs subdirectory to AppLogs/system/sent_emails.

29. Task prune logs have been moved from the Tomcat /logs subdirectory to AppLogs/system/task_prune.
