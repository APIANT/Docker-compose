1. The Shopify "update order as fulfilled" action now lets the location be specified.

2. When unprocessed webhooks are retried, they are no longer placed in the work queue if already in the queue.  The system's previous behavior did not cause duplicate processing, but did cause the admin console to not show a count of unique webhooks queued.

3. Added an appendToTempLog() method to appRPC that can be used from inline Java JSP in assemblies to append content to a temporary log in the same manner as done with the Logging - Write to Log module.  The main motivation is to provide a way to log trace information for troubleshooting web service assemblies.

4. The automation execution engine no longer retries failed actions that are configured to "continue if error" in the action's settings.

5. The system's retry transaction queue is now pruned every 30 minutes to remove stale transactions, to avoid an ever-growing list in the Admin Console's Native Work Queue screen.

6. Added a Phone Number Parser module that can parse a phone number from any block of text.  The parsed number is formatted as E.164 international format and in the country's national format, plus any extension is parsed separately if found.

7. Added a "parse phone number" action for the Transform Text app.

8. When editing an automation in the Automation Editor, the Save button now highlights whenever there is an unsaved change.

9. Fixed an issue that would cause the assembly editor to become empty after saving an assembly with a modified name or any other change that would cause the catalog to refresh itself.

10. The DateTime - Translation module has been deprecated and replaced with a new version that now expects epoch input values to be in seconds only.

11. The Transform Date Time "modify and reformat date time" action has been deprecated and replaced with a new version that now expects epoch input values to be in seconds only.

12. The ONTRAPORT integration has been deprecated and replaced with a new version that uses their latest API.

13. The action field mappings screen in the automation editor now has a checkbox at the bottom left for showing only required fields.

14. The "show only mapped fields" checkbox at the lower left of the action field mappings screen in the automation editor now does its processing in a manner that doesn't hang the browser when a large number of fields are present.

15. Fixed an issue that would cause the list of action field mappings to not scroll correctly when configuring a newly added action that required fetching dynamic fields.

16. In the Admin Console's Protocol Thread screen, the Deactivate button is now visible to accounts other than the super admin account, so developers can start and stop their unary protocol threads in order to make code changes.

17. If an automation using an "execute automation" action is deployed and it doesn't have an automation selected, a SQL exception no longer occurs.

18. The MySQL "any new row" trigger has been deprecated and replaced with a new version that allows the selection of a column used to order the rows by newest first.

19. Added a "new or updated row" trigger for MySQL.

20. The SQL Server "any new row" trigger has been deprecated and replaced with a new version that allows the selection of a column used to order the rows by newest first.

21. Added a "new or updated row" trigger for SQL Server.
