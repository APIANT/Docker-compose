1. Microsoft Dynamics CRM online has been integrated with a "new or updated opportunity" trigger.

2. The system now retains a history of monthly tasks.

3. The Admin Console now displays the system's month-to-date total tasks at the bottom of the Automations screen.

4. The system now checks its license key every midnight (rather than only upon bootup) and will email the system admin if the license key will expire in 30 days or in 7 days.

5. The Gmail "send email" action now handles Base64-encoded error messages when the OAuth token is not accepted.

6. If the browser loses communication to the server, a message is now displayed.

7. The baseline docker-compose.yml now has an added health check for MySQL.  The main purpose is to not allow the Tomcat webapp container to start until after MySQL has finished starting.

8. When modules are imported, any existing Java code is now string-compared to check to see if a compilation is needed or not.  Previously, only the timestamp of the existing Java file and the file being imported were being checked.

9. The system will now operate without errors in Docker when the docker-compose.yml APIANT_DOMAIN environment variable and the Tomcat webapp uses a different port than 8080.  Previously, functionality like web service URL invocations would not work as expected due to internal errors related to the Tomcat webapp trying to reach itself via URL invocations to APIANT_DOMAIN when it should have always been using port 8080 which is what Tomcat always listens on within the container.

10. When running an assembly in the Assembly Editor, if a module has an error it is now brought to the front of other modules, in case the errored module happened to be hiding behind another module and wasn't visible.

11. In the Admin Console's "App Catalog" screen, the "Implemented" checkboxes have been removed.  Instead, implemented app names now have "IMPLEMENTED" appended to their names on a new line, unless the "Implemented" category filter is selected at the top.

12. In the Admin Console's "App Catalog" screen, the greyed-out app icons have been removed b/c they are no longer used in the system.

13. In the Admin Console's "App Catalog" screen, two new buttons have been added to hide and unhide all apps in the system.

14. In the Admin Console's "App Catalog" screen, the dropdown list of app categories at the top of the screen is now searchable.

15. In the Admin Console when managing an app's details from the "App Catalog" screen, the dropdown list of app categories is now searchable.

16. In the Automation Editor, when building an automation and selecting an app, the dropdown list of app categories is now searchable.

17. The "Settings" screen in the Admin Console is no longer displayed when the system is running in Docker, b/c all settings are controlled by docker-compose.yml environment variables.

18. Added <cronPruneTempFiles> and <maxTempFileAgeDays> settings to the system's config file for controlling the deletion of temporary files generated by assemblies on the server's filesystem.  Some automations use temp files in their processing, e.g. the PDF app creates generated PDFs as temp files.  The ability for automations to retry failed transactions can depend on the availability of temp files.

19. Added a APIANT_MAX_TEMP_FILE_AGE_DAYS environment variable to the baseline docker-compose.yml for controlling the deletion of temporary files generated by assemblies on the server's filesystem.

20. The metrics reported in the Admin Console's "Native Work Queue" screen are now also reported via a JMX MBean.  Tools like jconsole and jvisualvm (with the MBeans plugin installed) can be used to monitor the native work queue metrics.

21. System upgrades no longer create and destroy a temporary database, which was being done as a means to reset a database connection back to the default database.

22. The Admin Consol's "Settings" screen now has a setting to control the maximum size of automation and batch job log files.

23. Added a <isWritingLogsToStdout> setting to the system's config file for controlling the ability to write automation and batch job logs to stdout.  If enabled, error messages are written to stderr (email alerts are still processed).

24. Added a APIANT_IS_WRITING_LOGS_TO_STDOUT environment variable to the baseline docker-compose.yml for controlling the ability to write automation and batch job logs to stdout.

25. All automation and batch job timestamps now report milliseconds.

26. The User Accounts screen in the Admin Console now displays a "Switchable" checkbox in the list of user accounts.  If unchecked, the "Switch Account" functionality cannot be used to switch to that account.

27. Cliniko has been integrated.

28. The system now uses the latest available version of the Quickbooks Online SDK.  Testing has shown it is backwards compatible.

29. The Admin Console's Native Work Queue screen now shows the execution status for each automation, e.g. "Executing action #2 for trigger data row 3 of 10".

30. The code that downloads files for the HTTP Transaction and OAuth Transaction "File payload URL" now sets the User-Agent header to the value configured in the system, as some servers return a 403 error if none is specified.

31. The baseline docker-compose.yml now includes HAProxy to support SSL, which is optional.
