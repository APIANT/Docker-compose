1. Conditionals in the automation editor can now be moved up/down.

2. Additional actions and conditionals can now be added after conditionals in the automation editor.

3. Conditionals and actions in the automation editor can now be freely moved around anywhere via the up/down arrows that appear when the items are moused over.  This includes moving items to and from conditional branches.

4. Individual actions in the automation editor can now be copied and pasted.  Click an action and select the "copy item" option.  Then click a "+" icon destination and choose the "paste item" option.  An action can be pasted into other automations.

5. Fixed a rare null pointer exception that could be emitted by VTDElement.getText() for certain XML nodes.
