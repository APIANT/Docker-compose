1. Made a fix to the Switch Account dialog so it works reliably on tablet devices, such that entering search information will update the list.

2. In the automation editor, up/down arrows to reposition triggers, actions, and conditionals are now always visible on tablet devices.

3. The automation editor is now scrollable on tablet devices.

4. If a nested subassembly in the Action Two-Way Sync module returns an error, the module now checks the system's configured list of retryable error messages and will flag the record to not be retried if the error message is not in the list.

5. The server now truncates error messages to be logged to stderr/stdout to 10 KB.

6. If an automation processed an extremely large amount of data and encountered an error, the system would not be able to write the retry information into the database due to it exceeding the MySQL max packet size, leading to a logged error message and the ommission of the error from the automation's history.  Now if the system cannot write the data to the database it will instead omit the retry information so that the database entry can be saved into the automation history to record the error (although the failed transaction can't be retried).

7. When pasting a query into the Switch Account dialog immediately after opening it, the search results for the pasted query are now returned instead of all accounts.

8. Extensive internal changes have been made to the system's source code so that the code's nomenclature matches the system's, e.g. "part" -> "module", "task" -> "automation".  Although the changes have been tested to the best of our ability, system behaviors could have been inadvertently affected.

9. Fixed an issue with connecting OAuth v2.0a apps in tenant systems when the OAuth v2.0 Workflow module's "append state param" option was unchecked.

10. The system's webhooks log is now stored in the appLogs/system directory rather than in appServerOutput.

11. The system's sent email log (internal only, stored in the tomcat log directory) and received webhook log (accessible via the developer menu in the assembly editor) are now rolled over when they reach 10MB in size, with up to 100 log files retained.

12. The system's webhook log is no longer erased when the system boots.

13. Protocol logs are now stored in appLogs/system/protocol_threads and appLogs/system/unary_protocol_threads rather than in appServerOutput/tmp

14. Protocol logs are now rolled over when they reach 10MB in size, with up to 100 log files retained.

15. The Docker APIANT_LOG_LONG_TRANSACTION_TIME_SECONDS environment variable setting has been removed from the baseline docker-compose.yml file.

16. The appRPC.m_singleton.readFully() method accessible in inline Java JSP code has been renamed to appRPC.readStreamFully().  The system upgrade migration script updates references in existing inline Java JSP code.

17. The appRPC.m_singleton.downloadFileToLocalFile() method accessible in inline Java JSP code has been renamed to appRPC.downloadFileFromURLToLocalFile().  The system upgrade migration script updates references in existing inline Java JSP code.

18. The appRPC.m_singleton.downloadFile() method accessible in inline Java JSP code has been renamed to appRPC.downloadFileFromURLToByteArray().  The system upgrade migration script updates references in existing inline Java JSP code.

19. The appRPC.m_singleton.getHTTPClient() method accessible in inline Java JSP code has been renamed to appRPC.getHTTPClient().  The system upgrade migration script updates references in existing inline Java JSP code.

20. The appRPC.getHTTPClient() method now take an HTTPMethod (such as GetMethod, PostMethod, etc.) as its input, rather than a string host name.  The system upgrade migration script updates references in existing inline Java JSP code.

21. Fixed an issue with the automation execution engine where actions that followed a conditional would not be executed if the conditional branches contained other nested conditionals.

22. Conditional branches in the automation editor are now rendered with the false branches going to the left instead of down.  Triggers are now rendered at the top above the actions going from left to right, rather than on the left side of the actions going from top to bottom.  Conditionals now displays lines with arrows at the end of true and false branches that help to make the logic flow easier to understand.  Conditional true and false branches are now labeled "yes" and "no".

23. On tablet devices, the automation editor no longer keeps the item up/down movement arrows always visible.  Instead, selecting a trigger/action now presents a new "move this item" menu option.  Selecting this menu option then makes the movement arrows visible.

24. Text within action field mappings can once again be selected by clicking and dragging.

25. When adding triggers or actions to an automation in the automation editor, the newly added trigger/action will scan the automation's definition looking for a trigger or action for the same app.  If the first found trigger or action uses a different connected account than "default", that account is now automatically selected for the newly added trigger/action.

26. The SQL Server "any new row" trigger has been fixed so an error doesn't occur when selecting the sort column while configuring the trigger.

27. The automation editor UI has been refreshed.

28. Triggers and subassemblies for Intercom have been updated so they work again due to a change in behavior with their API.

29. Actions and conditions within the automation editor have a new menu option to disable/enable them.  When disabled, the automation execution engine will skip them and log an entry about it.

30. In the automation editor's "manage stored data" and "two-way sync mappings" screens, the page size can now be set to 10, 25, 50, or 100 rows via a dropdown pick list.

31. In the automation editor's "manage stored data" and "two-way sync mappings" screens, search queries now return matches that contain any portion of the entered search text, rather than only exact matches.

32. Added a "find row" action for MySQL and SQL Server apps.
