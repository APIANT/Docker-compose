1. The Conditional Execution [Data Stream] v2, Data Rows - Filter v2, Data Rows - Conditional Loop v2, and Fatal Error [Data Stream] v2 modules all now support scalar values in the left-side logic tests.

2. Automation field mappings are now initially collapsed.  Each trigger and action can now be individually expanded and collapsed to help make finding fields easier.

3. Fixed the automation field mappings search functionality so field names having spaces can now be searched.

4. Webhook automations no longer process queued webhooks if the automation is turned off.  The queued webhooks will be processed when the automation is turned back on, according to the system's schedule for retrying unprocessed webhooks.

5. When a webhook automation is reset (via the gear icon menu option in the dashboard) any unprocessed webhooks in the work queue are now purged.

6. The automation editor and assembly editor are now fully supported on tablet devices.  Testing has been done on a 12.9 inch iPad Pro.  Notable changes in the assembly editor to support the touch interface include the following:  To access the right-click context menu of catalog items, double tap them.  To access the right-click context menu of the main canvas, use the "Options" link at the bottom right above the Zoom slider.  To select multiple modules for copy/delete, instead of dragging a selection region click the "Select" link at the bottom right above the Zoom slider.  Then tap the modules to be selected.  Tap selected modules to unselect.  Tap the background to unselect all.  Click the "Stop Selection" link at the bottom right to exit the selection mode, or click the "Options" link at the bottom right which also exits selection mode.  The functionality of module right-click context menus is now mirrored in the module settings popover that appears when modules are tapped.  When wires are dragged, the end of the wire is placed above the fingertip, but to connect the wire move your fingertip over a destination wire node.  This is done so you can see the dragged wire node turn green when a valid destination can be connected.  The vertical and horizontal splitter controls are much wider so they can be easily tapped or dragged.  Controls that are normally hidden until moused over are instead always visible.  3rd-party editor libraries used for editing code and for field mappings in the automation editor have been updated to their latest versions so that momentum scrolling is available.

7. Fixed an issue with the automation editor where actions having validated parameters could not be saved due to a runtime error.

8. In the assembly editor, when wire connectors are joined/unjoined the diagram now automatically scrolls if needed to keep them in view.

9. Canvas dialog windows are now resized to remain in view if the browser window is resized.

10. When templates having webhook triggers are installed, the system now requires that the automation be edited and the trigger configured.  Previously this was only needed if the webhook trigger had the "requires test transaction" checkbox in the Webhook module checked, but this did not account for triggers that register the webhook URL via API calls.

11. Added "Delete file", "Delete folder", and "Rename file" actions for the FTP app.

12. The Quickbooks Online baseline integration has been migrated to use OAuth v2.0 instead of v1.0a.  The integration was not deprecated and replaced with a copy b/c of the large number of existing automations, plus the fact that the existing integrations will stop working anyway when Intuit turns off support for OAuth v1.0a in December.  All existing Quickbooks Online automations will need to have their connected accounts reconnected in order to work.  Systems using Quickbooks Online need to obtain OAuth v2.0 API keys and load them into the system's keychain via the Admin Console.

13. Fixed an issue with the Data Rows - Sort module where the server-side Java implementation would throw a "Comparison method violates its general contract" runtime error if all the selected XML nodes did not have the same schema where some of the sort criteria nodes were not present.

14. In the Switch Account dialog, user accounts can now be looked up by UUID.

15. The automation execution engine now records the evaluation of trigger filters into the debug log, to help troubleshooting trigger filter logic.

16. Connections in the automation editor's connections screen are now searchable by app name.

17. The HipChat integration has been deprecated b/c the app is being shut down.

18. Fixed an issue where new modules that support "xpath:" preceding their data paths would not receive the "xpath:" when used as submodules nested within other modules.  This would cause the nested module to perform incorrect processing.

19. Fixed an issue with the execution of assemblies in the assembly editor where Simple DB modules embedded in subassemblies would not use the correct "automation" scope when testing.

20. The system's PDFBox libraries have been upgraded from v1.8 to the latest v2.0.16.  In the baseline system they are only used for the "text to PDF" action.

21. The Simple DB - DELETE and Simple DB - INSERT modules now log all their inputs, to aid troubleshooting.

22. Fixed the Recurly "update account" action.

23. Trigger and action step notes are now displayed in the list of mappable data fields, to help identify automation steps when mapping data fields.

24. Actions for "system apps", like the Transforms, no longer count as processed tasks.

25. The Transform Text app now has "convert JSON to XML" and "convert XML to JSON" actions.

26. The "URL" app now has a "send a POST payload" action.

27. Double-clicking a module or subassembly in the assembly editor now always causes the assembly to be executed to that point, rather than it not executing unless the module was dirty.

28. The Admin Console's "System Settings" screen has a new option to disable all system exports.

29. The Admin Console's "Native Work Queue" screen now shows the number of active webhook receiver threads and the peak number of webhook receiver threads.

30. The "Subassembly Output (Dropdown Parameter)" module has been renamed to "Subassembly Output (Populated Parameter)".

31. Added a new System app action "read query parameter value", which reads a query parameter passed to the automation via the System app's "execute automation" action.

32. Added a new "Multi-Select Parameter (Populated)" module that can be used to configure triggers and actions.  The module presents a scrollable list of items where one or more items can be selected.  The list is populated from a subassembly, like is done with populated dropdown parameters.  The list can be optionally searchable.

33. The Switch Account dialog can now search for an account by entering an automation number.
