1. When saving an app assembly in the Assembly Editor, the owner of the app assembly will see a new "Protected" checkbox underneath the app category dropdown.  If checked, no other user accounts can add or edit triggers or actions for the app, unless they have the Assembly Administrator permission.

2. Fixed an issue where the "Error Handling -> Send an email on any timeout" gear menu option in the automation editor dashboard was not displaying the checkmark when the option was enabled.

3. Fixed an issue that prevented data path dropdowns in the assembly editor modules from being populated, even though data was loaded into the modules.

4. Fixed the movement of focus when form elements are tabbed such that a disabled control is skipped.
