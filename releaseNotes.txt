1. The pruning of logs stored in S3 is now done in batches of up to 1,000 items, rather than one-by-one.

2. Inline JSP within assemblies no longer uses the "appRPC" bean.  Instead, a bean defined as "appJSP" is used instead that references a different class on the server.  The system upgrade migrates existing inline JSP code.  Javadocs accessible from the Developer menu in the Assembly Editor have been updated accordingly.

3. Big structural changes have been made to the system's server-side code.  System functionality is intended to remain the same, but the changes may cause inline JSP within assemblies to not compile even though the system upgrade attempts to migrate all changed references.  Contact support@apiant.com if automations that previously worked now show Java stackdumps in their logs and we will help fix.

4. Due to performance issues with ActiveMQ, a queue per webhook automation is now used instead of a single queue.

5. The Admin Console's Work Queue screen has a new button that cleanly drains the queue, such that automations currently executing will complete their processing of all data rows.  This is unlike the lock work queue functionality, which causes executing automations to halt processing after the current data row, even if more data rows remain to be processed.

6. The automation editor dashboard's gear menu "View lucene dump" has been removed b/c some automations produce many GB of data in Lucene.  Instead, accounts having the Assembly Developer or Switch Account permission will see an "eye" icon in the top-level automation history tiles that can be clicked to view all data stored in Lucene for just that execution of the automation.

7. Fixed the automation editor's history view so that successfully retried transactions will not show the Retry button.

8. When drilling down into the lowest-level automation history in the automation editor, actions now display the radio buttons for halting/continuing on errors.

9. Fixed an issue that would cause webhook automations to have dangling top-level history tiles that showed "executing" and the spinning logo.  The fix only prevents new dangling entries from occurring, it doesn't remove existing ones.

10. The automation editor's lowest-level automation history view now indicates which paths conditionals take by coloring the true/false branch green/red respectively.

11. The system now uses the latest available version of Hazelcast.

12. Automations that are timed out no longer remain in an executing state for up to 15 minutes.

13. When automations are timed out, the lowest-level automation history screen now shows the timed-out step in red and the item's log is now available.

14. Trigger filters and conditionals in the automation editor now have a "is valid email" condition that succeeds when the email has a valid syntax.

15. The Admin Console Work Queue screen's "halt work queue" button has been repositioned to be the 3rd listed b/c it should not typically be used.  It also now presents a validation dialog when stopping the work queue, informing that all executing automations will be immediately halted.
