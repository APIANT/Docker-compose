1. Automation history no longer displays "CUSTOMER_ALERT" messages in logged errors.  This change takes effect for newly logged errors only.

2. The top-level automation history screen now only auto-updates as the automation executes if only a single page of history has been loaded, or if the scrolled view is at the top of the history.  This change prevents the screen from being cleared and reset to the top when the automation runs when viewing old history entries, such that the auto-refresh doesn't interfere with troubleshooting.
