1. When data rows are filtered, the automation execution engine no longer stores unused data in the database about the data row, to reduce database storage of filtered data by about 50%.

2. Baseline assemblies that used old techniques for obtaining the location of the system's temp directory and temp directory URL have been refactored to use the output from the System Info module.

3. Fixed an issue when connecting the Date Time system app or when saving automations when the "let me define a schedule" option was selected where the Date Time timezone selection dialog was empty.

4. Fixed an issue where an automation could not process its Daily Schedule b/c the XML had surrounding apostrophes after being edited.

5. Fixed runtime errors with the SFTP triggers caused by selecting "." as the server's directory to watch for new/updated files.

6. Fixed a runtime error that would occur in the VTD-XML parser when an assembly having a module with a nested subassembly was run on the server.

7. The Craigslist "new post from search" trigger has been updated so it works once again.

8. The "Stocks" app and its triggers have been removed b/c Yahoo has terminated its data feed.

9. The GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToTraining, and GoToWebinar integrations have all been migrated to use their new API endpoint URLs.

10. In the automation editor's dashboard, "daily schedules" for automations have been renamed to "execution windows" to better reflect their functionality.  Also added a reset link at the bottom of the execution window popover to reset all execution windows to their default values.

11. Fixed an issue that would cause the icon picker dialogs in the assembly editor to not display all available images.

12. When a timeout occurs while fetching data when configuring triggers/actions in the automation editor, the error message now simply displays "Timed out while fetching data, please retry." rather than a message that includes the usually long and messy URL.

13. The "Switch Account" dialog now has a button at the bottom to switch back to the original account, which will appear after switching to an account.

14. The "Switch Account" dialog now has a selection dropdown that appears if the system has at least one tenant, for choosing among tenant organizations.

15. When running an automation manually in the automation editor, the prompt to choose the execution mode of normal/test/export now displays help text underneath each option, rather than in a mouseover tooltip.

16. Fixed a rare issue that would prevent multiple accounts from being connected to apps that used OAuth, when the app assembly contained a subassembly that used Service Credentials modules or OAuth modules.

17. Fixed an issue where field mappings within Conditional logic were appearing as "Action #null" when deployed to other accounts.

18. If an Action Output module has static output fields defined, any dynamic output fields having the same names as any static fields are no longer duplicated in the list of mappable output fields in the automation editor.

19. Bulk exports and imports of multiple automations are now supported.  Bulk exports are performed via a new "Export all" button that appears in the automation editor's dashboard for accounts that have permission to export.  The button exports all currently selected automations.

20. When automations are imported, the System "execute automation" & "turn automation on/off" actions are now updated to reference the appropriate automations, if they exist in the system.

21. Bulk deployments of multiple automations are now supported.  Bulk deployments are performed via a new "Deploy all" button that appears in the automation editor's dashboard for accounts that have permission to deploy automations.  The button deploys all currently selected automations.

22. When automations are deployed in bulk, the System "execute automation" & "turn automation on/off" actions are now updated to reference the appropriate automations, if they exist in the batch of automations being deployed.

23. When actions are edited in the automation editor, conditionals having logic that reference the edited actions's output fields are now updated.  Previously the referenced fields would become invalid and show "Action #x null".

24. Actions in the automation editor now have radio buttons in their settings that controls error handling behavior.  The default is to halt the execution at that point so no subsequent actions process the trigger data row, which is the system's current behavior.  A new option is to continue excecution.  All actions now output an "action error message" data field.  If an action results in an error, that data field will contain the error message.  Conditional logic can be used to branch upon the value of the action error message in order to perform specialized error handling processing.

25. The right side of conditional decision logic in the automation editor can now have data-mapped fields.
