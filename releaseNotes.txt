1. If an automation encounters an internal system exception while executing, now the automation cleanly terminates processing instead of remaining stuck in a zombie running state.

2. If a search is performed in the automation editor's dashboard and no results are found, if a folder has been selected the message that says no automations are found now includes the name of the folder that was searched.

3. The admin console's user accounts screen now highlights a parent linked account in blue.

4. Clicking on a link icon next to an account in the admin console's user accounts screen now performs a search query that returns all linked accounts in the group.

5. The Switch Account dialog now shows link icons for linked accounts.  Clicking a link icon performs a search query that returns all linked accounts in the group.  Parent accounts are highlighted in blue.

6. Exports and publishing of large automations with many actions have been greatly optimized by removing replicated content.  A large automation that previously took 4 minutes to export now takes 5 seconds.

7. When an automation is edited that contains nested groups, inner grouped items no longer erroneously appear when the outer group is opened.

8. Accounts having the "Publish to Production" permission on development systems now have a "Publish all" button in the automation editor's dashboard to publish all selected automations to production servers at once.

9. In the automation editor, after performing a "find items mapped to this" on an action, if an item is edited the editor no longer resets the scroll position to the first found item's position.

10. The total number of tasks in the automation editor's dashboard can now be clicked, which opens a dialog showing a bar chart of daily task history.

11. Added a "count array elements" action to the Transform Data app.

12. Added a "remove newlines" action to the Transform Text app.

13. When grouping actions in the automation editor, if a single action is selected to be grouped then following actions are no longer erroneously included when the group is created.

14. After the "find items mapped to this" right-click context menu option is used for an action in the automation editor, when selected actions are opened the mapped item is now highlighted within field mappings.

15. The link icon next to linked automations in the dashboard can now be clicked in order to unlink automations.

16. When a previously linked automation is deployed, the system now prompts to ask whether or not to link the automation, instead of assuming that all subsequent deployments will also be linked.

17. Added a "Get multiple values" action to the Lookup Tables app.

18. The non-deprecated Simple DB modules can now be placed as submodules within Loop modules in the assembly editor.

19. The admin console's Work Queue screen now shows the progress of automations as their loops process iterations, including for nested loops.

20. The automation history screen's execution status (highlighted with a green background at the top) now shows the progress of automations as their loops process iterations, including for nested loops.

21. When a linked parent account is given the "Deploy Automations" permission, the deploy automations dialog will now only fetch linked child accounts rather than all accounts.

22. The assembly editor now saves its session of opened tabs.  If the editor is closed with opened tabs, the next time it is loaded the editor prompts to ask if the previous session of opened tabs should be restored.  Tabs that contain older versions of assemblies or version comparisons are not currently included in sessions.

23. In the automation editor's history screens, when "Retry All Errors" is used the UI no longer display a modal timer dialog and instead goes to the top page of automation history (if the 2nd-level drilldown page was being used) and progress is now shown via the typical green highlighted activity bar near the top of the page.  This allows retry processing to be halted, which was previously not possible.

24. Error transactions being manually retried from the automation editor's History screens now appear in the Admin Console's Work Queue screen.

25. In the automation editor's history, when retrying failed transactions and choosing the "re-use stored data" option, the system now prompts to ask if the retry should be performed from the action that failed or from the first action.  Previously the system would only retry from the failed action.

26. In the automation editor's history, when retrying failed transactions and choosing the "manually edit stored data" option, after saving the edited data the system now prompts to ask if the retry should be performed from the action that failed or from the first action.  Previously the system would only retry from the failed action.

27. In the automation editor's history screens, the Retry All functionality now processes all transactions that match the current search and filter, rather than just the records loaded into the browser (25 records per page).

28. In the automation editor's history top-level screen, the Retry All functionality now only retries transactions matching the search query and date range.

29. In the automation editor's history screens, when "Retry All Errors" is used and more than 10 records will be retried, the UI now displays a confirmation prompt before starting the retries.

30. The Automation Info and System Info modules now emit the automation's name.  The name will be empty when running in the assembly editor or automation editor.

31. If an automation's execution is skipped due to its defined execution window, the system now displays an information entry in the automation's history screen.

32. Fixed a database connection error that would occur when deploying very large automations.

33. ActiveMQ has been upgraded from v5.15.11 to v5.15.13.  Versions later than v5.15.13 are not compatible with the system, primarily due to needing Java 9 (the system currently uses Java 8).

34. Hazelcast has been upgraded from v4.0.1 to v4.2 and its management console accessible via the admin console's Hazelcast Dashboard screen has also been upgraded.

35. Hawt.io has been upgraded from v2.8 to v2.13.2.  It is used in the admin console's ActiveMQ Dashboard screen.

36. Popovers that display assembly and automation version history now wrap the version text on multiple lines, rather than using tooltips to display all text.

37. When the "find items mapped to this" right-click context menu option is used on an action, if mappings to the action are removed from conditionals and loops they are now unhighlighted.

38. Both the Switch Account dialog (for admins) and the Switch dialog (for admins and for parent accounts having linked child accounts) in the automation editor now open the selected account in a new browser tab/window.

39. The Account Data screen in the automation editor (accessed via the "User account data" right-click menu option on the dashboard's background) now has an "Export as CSV" button that will download all records matching the search query as a CSV file.

40. The "Manage Stored Data" submenu item under the "Processing" section of the automation gear icon menu in the automation editor's dashboard has been renamed to "Inspect Stored Data", to avoid confusion with the "Manage" top-level menu section.

41. An issue that caused tabs in the assembly editor to become incorrectly sized too small after an assembly was saved with a change to its name is believed to be fixed.

42. The "Lookup country name or abbreviation" and "Lookup US state name or abbreviation" actions in the Lookup Table app have been deprecated and replaced with new versions that fix misspelled output fields.

43. Added a "Lookup region name or abbreviation for any country" action to the Lookup Table app.

44. The admin console's User Accounts screen has a new "Unlink Account" button that can be used to unlink a child account from its parent account.

45. The OneDrive integration has been deprecated due to Microsoft changing its API.

46. Added a "Save multiple mapped values for key" action to the Lookup Tables app.

47. After deploying an automation, the confirmation dialog that appears no longer displays editor settings on the left side or line numbers, and the dialog is narrower.

48. The system now supports saving an optional phone number with accounts.

49. The "Create or update account" "System" app action now supports a phone number.

50. All "System" app instant triggers that emit customer information now emit a phone number field.

51. The automation editor now limits the total number of actions in an automation to 150.  The editor will display an alert when more than 140 actions are added.  Large automations slow down the browser when editing or viewing history and eventually hit a configured database limit that controls how much data can be saved.  Large automations can be either broken into multiple smaller automations, or more complex actions can be built with the assembly editor that perform more functionality vs. individual steps.

52. After clicking the plus "+" icon to add a trigger or an action in the automation editor, a new "System utility" category option appears.  Selecting this option opens a pick list of system utility triggers or actions.

53. When a non-webhook sub automation called by another automation via the "execute automation" action has its concurrency set to -1, the system now executes the sub automation rather than it remaining queued for execution.

54. Assemblies and modules no longer allow a forward slash "/" in their names.

55. Added a "Fatal Error with Postprocessing [Data Stream]" module that will execute a nested module or subassembly before the parent assembly is halted due to an error condition.

56. When deploying an automation to multiple accounts, a failure in one or more accounts will no longer halt processing.  The automation will be deployed to as many accounts as possible.  Any errors will be displayed in the summary.

57. When mapping fields in the automation editor, actions that have at least one output field can now have additional fields manually entered by name.  This can be used when an action is known to output a certain field but the field is not present in the list.
